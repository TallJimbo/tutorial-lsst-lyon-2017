DM Stack Tutorial for LSST@Lyon 2017
====================================

This tutorial was intended to be run in a JupyterHub environment
provided for the Lyon meeting, but it should be usable on any system
with Jupyter, the w_2017_21 release of the LSST DM stack (or similar;
see pipelines.lsst.io for installation instructions), and the
https://github.com/lsst/ci_hsc package available with slight
modifications.
