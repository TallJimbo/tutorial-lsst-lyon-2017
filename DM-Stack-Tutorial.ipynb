ISR is actually a `CmdLineTask`, a special kind of task that can be run from the command-line and use the data butler for all of its inputs and outputs (regular `Task`s generally do not use the butler directly).

The DM stack does have specialized display code, but it either requires DS9 (which requires some ssh tunnels to use with data living on a server) or a Firefly server installation. For this tutorial, we'll just throw together a naive matplotlib display function, and create a view to a subimage that we'll display instead of the full image.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` is an image object that actually holds three image planes: the science image (`Exposure.image`), an image of variance in every pixel (`Exposure.variance`), an integer bit mask (`Exposure.mask`).  It also holds a lot of more complex objects that characterize the image, such as a point-spread function (`lsst.afw.detection.Psf`) and world-coordinate system (`lsst.afw.image.Wcs`).  Most of these objects aren't filled in yet, because all we've run so far is ISR.  It doesn't generally make sense to perform mathematical operations (i.e. addition) on `Exposure`s, because those operations aren't always well-defined on the more complex objects.  You can get a `MaskedImage` object with the same image, mask, and variance planes that does support mathematical operations but doesn't contain `Psf`s and `Wcs`s (etc) with `Exposure.maskedImage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Exposure.image` and `Exposure.variance` properties return `lsst.afw.image.Image` objects.  These have a `.array` property that returns a `numpy.ndarray` view to the `Image`'s pixels.  Conceptually, you should think of an `Image` as just a `numpy.ndarray` with a possibly nonzero origin.\n",

    "- The `Exposure.mask` property returns a `lsst.afw.image.Mask` object, which behaves like an `Image` with a dictionary-like object that relates string labels to bit numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of these image-like objects have a `getBBox()` method, which returns a `lsst.afw.geom.Box2I`.  The minimum and maximum points of a `Box2I` are specified in integers that correspond to the *centers* of the lower-left and upper-right pixels in the box, but the box conceptually contains the entirety of those pixels.  To get a box with a floating-point representation of the same boundary for the `extent` argument to `imshow` below, we construct a `Box2D` from the `Box2I`.\n",
